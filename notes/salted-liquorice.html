            <h1 class="c4" id="h.thcpzmut3hno"><span class="c8">Salted Liquorice</span></h1>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">For the longest time, ultra dark chocolate has been the unparalleled contender in my guilty pleasures list. But, I just gave salted liquorice or salmiak a try, and I am hooked. Dark chocolate &ndash; you better pull your belt buckle up because sal(miak)&rsquo;s about to make things rowdy.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <h2 class="c5" id="h.w9e4xujypba3"><span class="c0">My Love-Hate Relationship with Liquorice</span></h2>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the States, when you think of liquorice, you think of Red Twizzlers &ndash; the ones that come in the large plastic jar. I never was a fan of those sticky, sweet treats, so when it came to my Halloween candies, Twizzlers were not a welcome sight. Never in a million years would I think it would become a favorite candy.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span>I believe liquorice popped up on my radar during COVID-19. I was researching alternatives to toothbrushes, and I stumbled upon liquorice sticks. I bought some and tried them out, but the wet wood against the gums of my teeth did not feel good. Anyways, that is a different story. I became interested in the </span><span class="c3">glycyrrhizin compound &ndash; the active ingredient in liquorice. It gives the liquorice that dry bitterness and sweetness alongside somatic effects. I think I just liked the flavor, and thus began my relationship with liquorice.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I started off with sweet black liquorice, and I thought it was pleasant. Definitely, I liked it more than the Red Twizzlers which were just sweet; black liquorice has a more complex, herbal flavor. Learning more about liquorice, I stumbled upon a rather obscure part &ndash; salted liquorice or salmiak. Salty, bitter, and sweet &ndash; this flavor combination sounded so metal, like something made in Hell. Honestly, I was intrigued, but you don&rsquo;t simply find salmiak in your typical Safeway or Albertsons. So, into the archive, it went.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p>
            <h2 class="c5" id="h.93iud3kdnx07"><span class="c0">Salmiak</span></h2>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">While I enjoyed black liquorice, it was more of an occasional, if-I&rsquo;m-in-the-mood treat. Recently, I visited a candy shop, and they happened to carry salmiak. I sure didn&rsquo;t look it, but I was excited. They had all kinds of salmiak &ndash; hard ones, soft ones, super salty, etc. I tried both the hard and soft ones. The hard one was coin-shaped, and it was actually rather hard &ndash; like eating a rubber eraser. It tasted just as rugged as it felt &ndash; salty and bitter. I kept searching for some hint of sweetness, but it was nowhere to be found. I turned towards the soft one, and immediately, I recognized the bittersweet flavor of black liquorice. The saltiness was a surprising add-in, and it left my palate confused, yet intrigued. I didn&rsquo;t come onto it just yet, but it definitely warranted further investigation.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next day, I decided to give the soft salmiak another try. I tasted the same flavors as before, but this time, with a more relaxed and focused mind, I noticed how the saltiness actually complemented the bittersweetness. The result is quite savory &ndash; similar to a teriyaki, but more salty and less sweet. </span></p>
            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If dark chocolate is the rodeo master, then salted liquorice is the frenzied bulls. You don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s up with it, but if you are mellow and smooth and go with the flow, you come out alright in the end. Well, that&rsquo;s my journey with liquorice. If you want to give salted liquorice a try, hey, I commend you for your open-mindedness and gusto. Hope you enjoy it as I have. Cheers! </span></p>

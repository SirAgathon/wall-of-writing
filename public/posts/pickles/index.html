  <section><p>TO take from a common saying, when life gives you _________, you make pickles. (The blank must be a type of fruit or vegetable) Relative to lemonade, pickles may be the sweeter choice — that is, in terms of health.</p>
<p>I grew up having a serving of yogurt a day. I thought it was just one of those things your parents tell you to do, and you do it, just like eating your veggies. As I grew older, I began to understand why my parents made me do the things I did; this was my “how babies are made” moment. Yogurt is a cultured milk product where cultured, loosely, means containing particular bacterial colonies. Pickles that have been lacto-fermented are cultured.</p>
<p>I am no doctor — just a health enthusiast. That being said, your gut is like a second brain. Bacteria colonies that live in your gut produce chemicals like serotonin which modulates your mood and functioning. Lots of research in the past decades have documented the importance of gut health in overall health. Yet, as with most things, moderation is key; having an overabundance of bacteria in your gut is not necessarily better. Still, the average American would benefit by eating more cultured foods. Pickles are a great way to do so.</p>
<p>Have no fear, pickling is quite easy. You take a vegetable or fruit and jar it up. Then, you pour a boiling saline solution (5%, typically) into the jar, making sure the contents are submerged. Then, you place a pickling weight and lid on top. After at least 3 weeks, your pickles are ready. (The longer the better, though) It is that easy — whodathunkit!</p>
<p>My go-to pickle has been cabbage — something akin to German sauerkraut. However, for those of you familiar with Taiwanese stinky tofu, my pickles are more akin to the pickled cabbage served alongside. I have included a picture of my setup below. Happy Pickling!</p>

Dear Holden,

I appreciate you for sharing your story, for it gives me hope that there are others who value authenticity and integrity in a world that seems to say otherwise. 

Frustrated, angry, disappointed, and lonely — these are the feelings that characterize the last four years of my life. I, too, dealt with the so-called jocks, and I, too, felt lacking and insecure when they seemed to be so popular and desired. I could not bring myself to play that part. I tried in high school, but I quickly realized that is not me. I chose to be myself.

I never quite got the lingo, so to speak. Perhaps if I tried hard enough and lied to myself, I would be able to play the part. But, as you said, it all seemed phony — and it was. In response to the phoniness all around me, my fervor for authenticity and integrity grew in proportion. I wanted to demonstrate to others that being yourself is cool. This became my cause over the last four years, but it put me at odds with most of everyone else.

In the end, like you, Holden, I considered running away, by dropping out of university. But, at the beckoning of my parents, I went back. This time around, I had the opportunity to meet some truly good people. From them, I learned about forgiveness and patience. As difficult as I was, they accepted my flaws and illuminated them for me — just like how Phoebe did for you. 

As I finish up my undergraduate degree over this summer, I resolve to closer examine myself. As cliché as it sounds, I seek to be more accepting of myself, so I may be more accepting of others. Lastly, if I may object to your final statement, I believe it is alright to miss everyone. To miss another is an act of love — something we both need a little more of.

All the best,

Jeff K. Wang

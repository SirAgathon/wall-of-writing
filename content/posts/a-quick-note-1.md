# Summary

As XR technology develops, we want to know why we should use this technology. From a meta-perspective, XR technologies are a key step in the advancement of our species. 

# Evolution

The primary goal of evolution is reproduction of species (a very incomplete way of saying the continuation of life). The mechanism by which evolution occurs is natural selection. You may be familiar with the term; nonetheless, we shall provide a quick description of the process. Natural selection is the process by which organisms change and (better) adapt to their environments. It does this via acting on genes, fundamental units of feature expression, and by features, we are referring to physical manifestations of organic material, suited for a purpose(s).

Natural selection is responsible for the variation in species on our planet. Then, wouldn't evolution be a divergent force?

Yes, evolution is a divergent force; however, it converges locally. Pick any continent. Then, zoom into a specific region. You will find most species in that region to have the same features. 

Since humans are not omnipresent, we must take a local perspective. Thus, evolution, in our context, is definitely convergent.

# The Evolution of Sense

Evolution is quite broad, so let us focus on sense. 

What is true reality? And, is what we are perceiving it?

This is a classical philosophical question, and it was first popularized by Plato in his Allegory of the Cave. Loosely put, the Allegory of the Cave is about a group of prisoners trapped in a cave, only being able to see shadows of entities behind them. One day, a prisoner breaks loose and leaves the cave. Outside, they are able to see the entities in their "true" form for the first time. Astounded, they go back into the cave to tell the others their revelation, but to their dismay, none of the others believe them. Who is right? Which interpretation of reality is the right one?

The Allegory of the Cave is a metaphor of Plato's Theory of Forms, which claims that the true nature of reality is not perceivable. Using the theory of evolution, we can prove this to be true. Suppose true reality is perceivable.

Definition 1 : The infinite set of environments is collectively known as true reality.

Definition 2 : An environment is a set of meta-data describing space and time.

Definition 3 : If set A is contained by set B, then set A is perceivable. 

Definition 4 : An entity is said to be evolved if it can survive in at least one environment.

Consider an evolved species with an initial set of environments (that it can survive in). Let us define the function of natural selection ...

# Extended Reality

There is a lot of apprehension around the nature of extended reality (XR). 

Is it a force of good or evil?

How will it affect our mental health?

What are the ethical guidelines?

I'm afraid there are no clear answers to these subjective questions. However, from an objective standpoint, I think where this is going is quite clear.

Whereas evolution constrains our vision and other senses, XR technologies expand them.

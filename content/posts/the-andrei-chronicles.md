A loud wailing arose from the castle grounds.

“Spare him, please! Take me instead!”

I raised my head for a moment to acknowledge the despair and resumed my reading. 

“****Sigh****, another one bites the dust,” thinking to myself. 

My father must have taken a fresh human baby from nearby Transylvania, and naturally, its mother came chasing after — only to suffer the same fate.\
\
\
At 4 AM, my father came in.

“Andrei, please do not leave your room without my permission. A human guest came over earlier this evening.”

“Sure, whatever you say,” I said without looking at him.

“Perrrfect. He is helping me manage our estate, and I do not want to scare him. Or, I’ll unfortunately have to send for another.”

The door closes. Soon after, the sun begins to rise. Without thinking any further, I go over to my coffin, slide over the lid, and fall into deep slumber.\
\
\
I wake up to the sound of my doorknob twisting back-and-forth. \
It stops. \
I get out of my coffin, walk over to the door, and, slowly, peek out. \
A figure steadfastly moves down the hallway. \
I quietly leave my room and follow.
As I get to the great staircase banister, I hear voices downstairs. One is my father’s, and the other is someone new. I infer that it must be the person my father mentioned yesternight. 

“Jonathan, I told you not to leave your room. Our castle is large, and I don’t want you to get hurt.”

“Count, you must excuse me. I’ve heard and seen some frightening things yesterday evening. I would like to leave as soon as possible.”

“Your boss and I have made an agreement. You may leave once your job is finished. I need those letters you promised me yesterday.”

“I’m sorry. I’ve been quite unprofessional, haven’t I? Here are the letters. Would you like me to go to the nearest village post office to send them on your behalf?”

“No, no. I’m more familiar with the area, so I’ll go out tonight to send them. Please go back to your room and make yourself comfortable.”

A brief silence ensued. I suspected Jonathan had wanted to say something more but could not. I went back to my room and looked out my window. \
\
\
Outside, the castle walls laid bare to me. \
A light turned on in a room downstairs left of mine. I could see Jonathan looking out the window. He suddenly turned towards my direction, but I knew he could not see me. \
\
He was a young, handsome man. His black hair swept neatly across his forehead. Yet, his eyes looked tired, and his face was a tad bit pallid. His expression took on one of perplexed-ness, and his eyes were searching. \
\
A little after, his room lights went out. Just as I was about to retire from the window, I see my father scaling the castle walls to fly out to Transylvania — I’m assuming to mail the letters.
Immediately after, I see Jonathan’s head jut out the window, looking at the direction my father departed. Then, he immediately ducks back in. \
\
\
I go back to my reading desk and close my book. I’m reading *The Scarlet Pimpernel* by Baron Orczy — for the third time in a row now. I picked up the book during one of my visits to Transylvania. It is by far one of my favorites. Sir Percy Blakeney is such an admirable figure — unlike my father, that is. \
\
I’ve taken a liking to these humans. I long for the Love they practice towards each other. Among our kind, love is a base behavior, solely defined by the act of transfusion. \
\
I think to myself for a bit while entertaining myself, licking my front fangs. Finally, I come to a decision. I have decided to play a little prank on my father — and to do this human a favor. From my chest, I dig through some things and find a rope. Then, I grab a map from my desk drawer. Then, I quietly head out my room. I know my father won’t be back for a while. In addition to mailing those letters, he will be looking for supper. \
\
Going downstairs and to Jonathan’s room, I place the rope and map outside. I could hear him pacing to and fro within. Just as I stood outside his room, I heard him stop and creep towards the door. I quickly leave to return to my room.
In a few moments, the gypsy band will come marching through the castle grounds, and if Jonathan is smart enough, he’ll know that’s his way out. \
\
Just a few moments after, the gypsy band is marching outside. I look towards Jonathan’s window and see his head peeking out. He quickly goes back inside, and a moment later, a rope is flung from his window all the way down to the castle grounds.

One leg and, then, another pop out the window and, soon after, his entire torso and head. I watch Jonathan scale down the castle walls with glee. Once on the ground, he runs after the gypsy band. 

See you later, Jonathan. I get up to start to head towards his room.

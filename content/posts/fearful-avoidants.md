Joe and Isaiah had been classmates in a math class. Isaiah is a distinguished scholar in mathematics, and Joe really admires his ability. Joe is working on a research project and needs ideas for modeling a particular event. Immediately, Joe thinks of Isaiah and comes up with a way of asking him for help.

Joe: Isaiah might know a thing or two about this. Let me give him a ping and see what he says.

Joe texts Isaiah. “Hey Isaiah, do you have a moment? I’m working on my research project and wonder if you know what distribution would best fit this.”

Isaiah replies, “Uhh… sure. Just send me an email.”

Joe thinks to himself, “Shoot, Isaiah must be super busy. I’m not sure if this was such a good idea…”

Since Joe already got a confirmation from Isaiah, he decides to follow through with the email. After writing the email, Joe reads it. 

“Dang, Isaiah is super smart. I wonder if I’m wasting his time by having him look at this. Am I being disrespectful?”

“I want Isaiah to know that I respect and think highly of him. Perhaps I should specifically say so?”

“Should I be asking him this?”

After ruminating a while, Joe sends the email. It reads:

Hey Isaiah,

Could you take a quick look at these graphs for me? 

[insert graph here] 

I tried modeling it with a Poisson distribution, but the model seems a bit off at the tail ends. Do you know how to adjust the Poisson distribution to fit the skewed ends? Or, maybe, there is a better distribution? Just let me know off the top of your head. Appreciate it!

Best,

Joe

Alex and Sarah had been talking for a month. They met through a volunteering event, organizing book fairs for kids. They are both open to a romantic relationship with each other, and both are subtly aware of this. Sarah is wondering why Alex has not asked her out yet. At the next meeting, Sarah brings along a male friend to try to get Alex jealous.

“I’m so excited for today’s meeting. I get to see Sarah!” thought Alex. Alex’s excitement and happiness quickly turn into despair. 

“I think we really get each other, and I like her so much,” thought Alex, “but, I don’t know how to say it.”

In fact, Alex has never had a girlfriend. Sure, he has had attention from girls, and he can interact with them — platonically, that is. Alex thought this time would be different.

At the meeting, Alex comes in and finds Sarah with another guy. Sarah looks at Alex and smiles. Alex half-smiles back.

“Who is this? What does this mean?” thought Alex, frantically. 

Sarah continued looking at Alex, expecting him to come over. But, Alex stood there for a bit. Then, he went to go sit in the corner.

“What is he doing?” thought Sarah, anxiously. “Am I wrong about him?”

“Calm down, calm down,” thought Alex, “he’s probably just a friend of hers. Still, I don’t feel comfortable with that guy around.” Amidst the chaos within, Alex looked stone-faced and unfazed.

Just then, the meeting started. Afterwards, Alex half-waved goodbye to Sarah and left hurriedly.

“What is she trying to tell me? Am I not good enough?!” thought Alex, as he walked home. 

“Was I wrong about him? Does he not feel the same way about me?” thought Sarah.

Ten minutes early!

Take a ticket,

Have a seat

Now serving,

Seventy - five!

Twiddle both my thumbs,

Glance from left to right,

How much time passed?

How much more?

Don’t get bored,

Stay sharp, stay sharp,

Breathe in, breathe out, repeat!

Inner restlessness,

it gets to me.

Must stay sharp —

Idleness

makes my eyes to

close hard shut, never

to wake up again.

Struggling to struggle.

Help, help, help me!

This is it!

Mr. Wang,

the doctor can

see you now. Thank you.
